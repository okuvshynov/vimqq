" Fork the current chat reusing the context from the first message.
" It is useful in cases of long context, but when you want to start a new
" discussion thread. For example,
"   :QF Suggest a simple task for junior engineer working on the project
"
" It will:
"   - take current chat's first message, keep the context and bot 
"   - modify the question with 'Suggest a ...'
"   - create new chat
"   - append amended message to new chat
"   - send new chat to the original bot
"
" This way we can reuse the context, which might be long (entire file/project)
