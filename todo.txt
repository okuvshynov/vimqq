1. Cleaning up request queue/prioritization/warmups

We have multiple mechanisms implemented now, need to make it better

2. using lucas index and prefetching while I'm still typing. 

Harder with local as there's no built-in function calling.

For example: I selected a piece of context and started typing. In the meantime, we already can:

* we should already have index itself processed.
* process the prompt + question/request
* call the tool in the background and start processing these files (?)
* exploring multiple chains in parallel?

product-like - generalizing idea of prefetch.

3. generalizing bots

4. extracting prompts

5. UI. 

Open in current window, not split by default?

6. Claude streaming

7. AutoFix TODO 

Observation: sometimes I notice a thing which I think would be easy for bot to fix.
I don't want to ask it do be fixed right now, as I'm in the middle of something else
So I leave TODO(bot) comment
Something should automatically parse these and fix one by one.


```
* e2e case study for some multi-file change
- other providers - openai, google
- Streaming for remote APIs (e.g. mistral)
- Caching for providers which support it
- Context generalization - github, treesitter, etc. Definitely need file tags.
- Tool use - let model decide on the context to ask for.
- CoT-like reasoning + blind testing (so, both shown/hidden modes)
- asking question multiple models at a time
- test on windows
- All TODO: from the codebase
```
