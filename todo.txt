* e2e case study for some multi-file change
* other providers - openai, google
* Streaming for remote APIs (e.g. mistral)
* Caching for providers which support 
* Context generalization - github, treesitter, etc.
* Tool use - let model decide on the context to ask for.
* CoT-like reasoning + blind testing (so, both shown/hidden modes)
* asking question multiple models at a time
* test on windows
* All TODO: from the codebase
