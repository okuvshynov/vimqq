```
* e2e case study for some multi-file change
- other providers - openai, google
- Streaming for remote APIs (e.g. mistral)
- Caching for providers which support it
- Context generalization - github, treesitter, etc. Definitely need file tags.
- Tool use - let model decide on the context to ask for.
- CoT-like reasoning + blind testing (so, both shown/hidden modes)
- asking question multiple models at a time
- test on windows
- All TODO: from the codebase
```
