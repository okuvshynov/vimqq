Let's first do 'manual' benchmark - reimplement https://github.com/okuvshynov/vimqq/commit/2a70eff1b84973e3989a08a967c32090c0072989

We need to configure the following as input:

1. base commit (with index)
2. version of vimqq 'making change' (also some commit)
3. bot configuration (including passing API keys)
4. validation steps.
