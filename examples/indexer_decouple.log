tests/mocks/mock_llama_cpp.py
This Python file defines a Flask-based mock server for llama.cpp. It implements API endpoints for 'alive' (health check), 'reset' (reset server stats), 'stats' (retrieve server stats), 'tokenize' (performs tokenization), and '/v1/chat/completions' (simulates a chat completion endpoint). The 'tokenize' endpoint returns a basic tokenized string. The '/v1/chat/completions' endpoint mimics a chat completion response, supporting both streaming and non-streaming modes. It includes logging for queries and handles warmup requests. It also maintains server statistics, such as the number of queries (chat, non-stream, warmup) and the number of deltas sent in streaming mode. The server handles SIGINT and SIGTERM signals for graceful shutdown. It uses argparse to take port and logs directory as arguments.

autoload/vimqq/ttft.vim
This file implements a time-to-first-token (TTFT) measurement system for VimQQ chats. The `vimqq#ttft#user_started_waiting()` function records the time when a user starts waiting for a message within a chat, storing the timestamp in the `s:latencies` table keyed by the chat ID. The `vimqq#ttft#first_token()` function measures and logs the time elapsed between the user's waiting start and the first token received in the chat, using the `reltime()` function to calculate the latency. The function also cleans up the stored latency timestamp after it has been used.  This allows for monitoring the responsiveness of the VimQQ server in different chats.

2. `autoload/vimqq/indexing/file.vim` - File operations related to indexing
3. `autoload/vimqq/indexing/git.vim` - Git file retrieval functionality
4. `autoload/vimqq/indexing/token.vim` - Token counting functionality 
5. `autoload/vimqq/indexing.vim` - Main entry point with backward compatibility
