SUCCESS: File created successfully.

22:46 info: anthropic stream closed.
22:46 sonnet: Now I've created a simple mock_api.vim file in the autoload/vimqq/api folder. This mock API implementation:

1. Calculates the length of the conversation by counting characters in all messages
2. Returns a response text that states the conversation length
3. Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses:
   - For streaming, it breaks the response into individual characters and sends them one by one
   - For non-streaming, it sends the complete response in a single JSON-formatted message

The API uses the existing llama_cpp_builder for message construction, similar to how llama_api.vim does it. The key difference is that instead of actually sending HTTP requests to an external service, it:

1. Calculates the conversation length
2. Creates a response message stating the length
3. Uses vimqq#platform#jobs#start to simulate an async process
4. Sends the response through the appropriate callbacks

For streaming responses, the mock API simulates real Server-Sent Events (SSE) by formatting each character of the response as an individual SSE message, which is then processed by the streaming builder.

For non-streaming responses, it formats the complete response as a JSON object similar to what would be returned by a real API.

This mock implementation should work well for testing purposes, allowing you to see how the plugin handles both streaming and non-streaming responses without needing to connect to an actual external API.
