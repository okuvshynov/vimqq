**14:38 info:** Setting title: Rename test_tools_schema to test_anthropic_adapter
**14:38 sonnet:** Now I understand the current test functionality. The test is checking the `tool_schema` function of the Anthropic adapter, which transforms tool definitions into a format compatible with the Claude API.

Let's also check how the tests are typically run in this project:

**14:40 sonnet:** All tests are passing! Here's a summary of the changes we made:

1. Renamed the test file from `tests/local/test_tools_schema.vim` to `tests/local/test_anthropic_adapter.vim`
2. Updated the suite name from `test_tools_schema.vim` to `test_anthropic_adapter.vim`
3. Added the following new tests:
   - `test_adapt_tools`: Tests the function that adapts a single tool.
   - `test_adapt_multiple_tools`: Tests the function that adapts multiple tools.
   - `test_run_with_system_message`: Tests the run function with system messages.
   - `test_run_with_tools`: Tests the run function with tools.
   - `test_run_with_thinking_tokens`: Tests the run function with thinking tokens and the on_sys_msg callback.

These tests provide more comprehensive coverage of the `anthropic_adapter.vim` functionality, including:
- Transformation of tool definitions to Claude API format
- Handling of multiple tools
- Processing system messages
- Integration with the thinking tokens feature
- Callback handling

The tests verify the core functionality of the adapter module, which is an important part of the VimQQ plugin's integration with the Anthropic Claude API.
