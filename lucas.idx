The plugin is composed of multiple modules, each providing a specific functionality, such as bot management, context gathering, autowarming, chat database management, dispatching, formatting, FuzzyFinder integration, job management, logging, main functionality, metrics collection, modeling, path handling, state management, UI management, and warmup management.\n\nThe bot management functionality, located in the `bots` directory, includes several Vimscript files, each defining a bot module for interacting with different AI models. The bot modules work together with the bot management functionality defined in the `bots.vim` file, which creates and manages a list of bot instances.\n\nThe context modules, located in the `context` directory, provide functions for gathering and displaying context information for a given message or selection. The modules work together to provide a comprehensive set of context information for the user's current selection.\n\nThe `autowarm.vim` file implements an autowarm feature, which sends \"warmup\" queries to a server or model to keep it ready for upcoming queries. The `chatsdb.vim` file manages chat history and data, storing and retrieving chat messages in a JSON database. The `dispatcher.vim` file manages the queue of queries, ensuring that each chat has alternate turns.\n\nThe `fmt.vim` file provides functions for formatting messages, while the `fzf.vim` file integrates FuzzyFinder for displaying the chat list. The `jobs.vim` file manages background processes, and the `log.vim` file provides a logging module for the plugin.\n\nThe `main.vim` file provides the main functionality of the plugin, defining functions for sending messages, showing chats, and handling events. The `metrics.vim` file collects metrics, saving them to a JSON file. The `model.vim` file manages the state of the plugin, notifying observers of events.\n\nThe `path.vim` file provides functions for working with file paths, and the `state.vim` file creates a new state object for managing the plugin's internal state.
