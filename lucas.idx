The `name` method returns the name of the tool, which is 'edit_file'. The `schema` method returns a dictionary that describes the tool's parameters, including the file path, needle, and replacement. The `run` method takes a dictionary of arguments and performs the replacement operation. It reads the file, counts the occurrences of the needle, and replaces it with the replacement if it exists only once. If the file is not found or the needle is not found, it returns an error message.
