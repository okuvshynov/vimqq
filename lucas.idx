The directory includes 10 prompt template files, each serving a specific purpose: prompt.txt, prompt_context.txt, prompt_context_index.txt, prompt_context_index_ui.txt, prompt_context_ui.txt, prompt_index.txt, prompt_index_ui.txt, prompt_index_warmup.txt, prompt_ui.txt, and reviewer_prompt.txt.\n\nThe templates can be broadly categorized into several groups based on their functionality. The first group includes prompt.txt, prompt_context.txt, prompt_context_ui.txt, prompt_index.txt, prompt_index_ui.txt, and prompt_ui.txt, which provide basic templates for user input with varying levels of context and UI-related information. The second group, comprising prompt_context_index.txt and prompt_context_index_ui.txt, offers more comprehensive templates that include an index summary of a code repository. The prompt_index_warmup.txt template is designed for warmup purposes and contains an index summary placeholder. Lastly, the reviewer_prompt.txt template is tailored for reviewers to evaluate the thinking process and outcome of attempts to resolve software engineering tasks.\n\nEach template file contains placeholders for specific information, such as {vqq_message} for the user's message, {vqq_context} for context, {vqq_lucas_index} for the index summary, and {vqq_tool_call} for a tool call. These placeholders enable the vimqq plugin to populate the templates with relevant data and provide a personalized experience for users. The relationships between these files are primarily based on their shared purpose of providing structured input templates for the vimqq plugin, with some templates building upon others to offer more detailed and contextualized input formats.",
