The APIs use a similar structure, with a main function that returns an object with a `chat()` method, which sends a request to the API with the provided parameters and returns a job ID.\n\nThe `chat()` method in each API takes optional parameters, including `stream`, which allows for streaming responses from the API. The APIs also define several callback functions for handling the API response, including `_on_stream_out()`, `_on_stream_close()`, `_on_out()`, `_on_close()`, and `_on_error()`.\n\nThe APIs use the `vimqq#platform#http#post()` function to send HTTP requests to the respective API endpoints.
