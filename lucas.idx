The API is designed to be a single layer that can be used by higher-level abstractions, as different providers have similar APIs but with some differences. The API consists of a single call, chat(params), which is similar to chat.completions.create. The params can contain various fields such as model, messages, max_tokens, stream, on_complete, and on_chunk. The file also highlights the differences between various providers, including llama.cpp, anthropic, and deepseek."

The bot manager has a list of bot instances and a default bot instance, and it includes methods for selecting a bot based on a question and for validating bot names.\n\nEach bot implementation extends the `vimqq#bots#bot` class and has its own configuration object that defines settings such as the API endpoint and model to use. Some bots, such as the Claude reviewer and DeepSeek reviewer, override the `_format` method to provide custom formatting for reviewer messages.\n\nThe directory also includes a README note that suggests merging the different bot implementations into a single implementation, with the bots becoming \"agents\" that can be configured to work with different APIs and provide different functionality. This would simplify the codebase and make it more flexible.\n\nThe files in this directory are autoloaded, and they check for the existence of specific variables to prevent multiple loads.
