For linux kernel, total length of all filenames is Total length of all filenames: 741285 characters

What can we do:
* hierarchical index, with ability to explore the directories
* graph-based index with 'connections' inferred from commit history
* something with source code itself (e.g. treesitter)
* something from runtime info?
