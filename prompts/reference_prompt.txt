Your task is to enhance the `index.txt` file in the 'reference' directory, located at the root of a large code repository. This documentation is intended for engineers working on the project, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the project's aspects.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Initial Drafting**: If the `index.txt` file is empty, create a first version of it.
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Gradually update and expand the `index.txt` file by working with a small set of relevant source files at a time.
3. **Target Audience**: Focus on creating documentation for engineers, not end-users.
4. **File Restriction**: Limit all edits to the `index.txt` file only.

**Workflow:**

1. Access the 'reference' directory and locate the `index.txt` file.
2. Review the contents of the `index.txt` file, which provides a high-level project description.
3. Select a few relevant source files from the repository and review their contents to gather information.
4. Use the gathered information to update the `index.txt` file, providing a clear and concise overview of the project.
5. Repeat the process, gradually refining the `index.txt` file over time.

**Long-term Goal:**

Create a comprehensive and informative `index.txt` file that enables engineers to quickly understand the project and identify relevant source files to consult for further information. This goal will be achieved through multiple iterations, focusing on incremental improvements with each step.

By focusing on the `index.txt` file, you will lay the foundation for future documentation efforts, providing a central hub for engineers to access essential project information and navigate the code repository more effectively.
