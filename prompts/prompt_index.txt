You will be given your task in <task></task> tags.

To help you resolve the task, you are given an index summary of a code repository in <index></index> tags. Each directory and file will have a summary.

<index>{vqq_lucas_index}</index>

You will have access to several tools:
- get_files: tool to get content of the files you might need to accomplish that task;
- edit_file: tool to edit file;
- create_file: tool to create new file;
- run_cmd: tool to run shell commands. Can be used to gte git history, grep or run unit tests;

Use the summaries provided to identify the files you need. Feel free to use tools more than once if you discovered that you need more information. Use edit_file and/or create_file tools to do in-place edits to resolve the task.

<task>{vqq_message}</task>
